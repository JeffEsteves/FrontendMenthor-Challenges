### Built with

### What I learned

Front-End Menthor is a great way to reinforce our knowledge and keep practicing. This project helped me to remind few things about CSS and HTML beginner level.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log("ðŸŽ‰");
};
```
